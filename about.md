### Who am I?

I'm a biochemist by training, but somewhere along that path I realised I could be more useful on a computer outside the lab, than manually doing experiments on my own! So I've been erratically drifting towards the world of tech for last 10 years or so and this personal site/blog is my attempt to start being more systematic about this move!

My plan is to start filling this space with my thoughts on the intersection of biology and tech, along with analyses made with interesting tools/techniques that I've approached tangentially in the past and would like to become more familiar with in the next few months.
