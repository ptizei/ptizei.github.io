## Footnotes
\* I did just find a nice and detailed [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-and-visualizing-resnets-442284831be8) explaining the architecture of the ResNet models, which I'll read once I'm done with this post and might also be useful to anyone who's curious.

\*\* You might remember that I already split 20% of all the spectrograms into a test set, which I'll only touch towards the end of this post, when I compare models trained with different sets of hyperparameters.
