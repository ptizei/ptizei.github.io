title: The Road Ahead
---

*Note: This post is going to be a bit more personal, so if you don't care to read my ramblings on what I'm currently doing and what I'm planning for the next few months, just give this one a skip and I promise to have more data-related goodness for the next post.* \*

About a month ago, I found out that I was being let go from my last position, which prompted me to finally go ahead with my long-planned reskilling into computational biology


*The Road goes ever on and on*
*Down from the door where it began.*
*Now far ahead the Road has gone,*
*And I must follow, if I can,*
*Pursuing it with eager feet,*
*Until it joins some larger way*
*Where many paths and errands meet.*
*And whither then? I cannot say.*
**-- J.R.R. Tolkien (in the voice of Bilbo Baggins)**






## Footnotes
\* I've just realised that with this post, I'm now on the fifth instance in a streak of roughly one post every 5 days. In the interest of keeping this nicely arbitrary trend going, I'm going to make this the update frequency for this blog. It will give me a quick metric to track and also act as a good way to hold myself accountable!
