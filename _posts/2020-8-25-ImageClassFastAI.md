title: Image classification with FastAI
---

Last weekend I started doing the [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) online course from the creator of the fastai python library, [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward). I'd been wanting to start it for a few weeks but I saw a tweet by Jeremy saying that new versions of the library and the course would be released, and now that they are out I think it was worth the wait! I had seen the first lecture of the previous version of the course and even started the fun process of setting up a google compute account to run the code from the course using their free credits on signup, as the course recommended until then. But now for this version, they simplified and just recommend using the free options in Google Colab or Paperspace, which has been super easy to set up!

The course itself seems like it will be a very practical introduction to various applications of deep learning, while also going down into some detail on what the models are actually doing and how to use the many features contained inside fastai, while just requiring some knowledge of python. In the very first lesson, you get to train an image recognition model to reliabley classify photos of cats vs dogs, using a dataset supplied by the course and with just a few lines of code that took less than a minute to run! But it really starts getting fun in the second lesson, where they actual
