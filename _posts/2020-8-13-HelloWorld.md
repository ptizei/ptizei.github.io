*taps mic* Is this thing on?

Welcome to my (hopefully, long-lived) new blog/personal site!

After leaving my most recent position, I've decided to finish taking the plunge and dedicate serious time to upskill in coding/data analysis! This blog will be my way of holding myself accountable, practice a style of writing I've never done in the past and also, hopefully, share some interesting/useful info with anyone that does follow.

In the next few weeks, I plan to start writing regularly on various personal projects that I have going, mostly in some intersection of biology and tech. I will try to keep things informal and approachable, but I'm sure my style will evolve with time.

If you'd like to know more about me, have a look at the [about]({{ site.baseurl }}/about) page. And if you'd like to send me any feedback, get in touch by email or Twitter DM!
